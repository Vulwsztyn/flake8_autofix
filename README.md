## Flake8 AutoFix

This script automagically fixes simple flake8 linting errors and warnings
All you have to do is run this script in the directory you want to lint/fix

If you drop the script in the same folder as your project
Example:
```
home/name/projectfolder > python3 flake8_autofix.py
```

Or if you have the script live somewhere else
Example:
```
home/name/projectfolder > python3 ../scripts/flake8_autofix.py
```

Whatever directory your terminal is on, is the one this script will autolint/fix
